  instructions: "HOW TO CREATE SCENARIOS\n===================\n\n1. About Scenarios\nEach
    scenario has its own folder. In this folder all videos, images, scenes and logs
    are saved. Each scenario may contain multiple scenes. These scenes are saved in
    .json files (if multiple .json files are found in the folder all files will be
    read).\n\n2. About Scenes\nScenes are the main building blocks for scenarios.
    The scenario begins with the first scene (the topmost scene in the first file)
    and progresses through the scenes until an end is reached. Each scene may define
    a background and multiple progressions or interactions.\n\n3. Configuration\nAs
    mentioned above, each scenario is configured with .json files. With these instructions
    an example .json file (scenes.json) should also have been generated, that file
    could be used as a base other scenarios. Here I will explain how to customise
    different parts of a scenario.\n\n3.1 JSON\nThe json format is quite simple. Each
    \"object\" is surrounded with '{}'. All objects can have many variables. All variables
    starts with a name (inside \"\") followed with a colon (:) and the value. The
    values can be one of the following types:\nText values (surrounded by \"\")\nNumber
    values\nOther objects (surrounded by {})\nLists (surrounded by [])\nBetween the
    variables and elements of lists are commas (,). Please see the example file for
    reference (spaces are optional but helps readability).\n\n3.2 Scene Configuration\nEach
    scenario .json-file contains a list of scenes. A scene object has the following
    variables:\r\n\u201Cname\u201D: The name of the scene\r\n\u201Cbackground\u201D:
    The background of the scene, can be a video, an image, a color or nothing (uses
    the same background as the previous scene)\r\n\u201Cending\u201D: If the background
    is a video then what should happen when the video ends, the options are \u201Cloop\u201D
    (the video loops), \u201Cexit\u201D (finishes the scenario) or the name of a scene
    (switches to that scene)\r\n\u201Cevents\u201D: A list of things that happens
    during a scene (see below)\r\n\r\n3.3 Event Configuration\r\nThe action objects
    have the following variables:\r\n\u201Ctime\u201D: When the action will happen\r\n\u201Caction\u201D:
    The options are \u201Cexit\u201D (finishes the scenario), the name of a scene
    (switches to that scene) or nothing (if this is a question)\r\n\u201Ctitle\u201D:
    If this is a question then place the question text here\r\n\u201Coptions\u201D:
    If this is a question then here is a list of options (see below)\r\n\r\n3.4 Option
    Configuration\r\nThe option objects have the following variables:\r\n\u201Cimage\u201D:
    The name of an image (if this option has one)\r\n\u201Ctext\u201D:\tAn optional
    description of the option\r\n\u201Caction\u201D: What should happen when this
    option is selected, the options are \u201Cexit\u201D (finishes the scenario) or
    the name of a scenario (switches to that scenario)"
